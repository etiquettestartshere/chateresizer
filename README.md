A minimal fork of [Sidebar and Windows Resizer](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/foundryvtt-sidebar-resizer) that removes resizing most windows except for the chat popout. This was originally made for personal use as the original module had some issues and was not working correctly in dnd5e on fvtt v12. This module is primarily maintained now for text roleplay purposes. Please pray that it can be maintained through the v13 appv2 apocalypse.
